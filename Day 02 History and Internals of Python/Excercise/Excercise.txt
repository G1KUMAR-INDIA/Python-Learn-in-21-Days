Day-2 Exercise Homework
Internals of Python
Section 1: History of Python
1.Short Answer Questions:
    o   Who created Python, and in which year was it first released?
    o   Why is Python named "Python"?
    o   Mention two major changes introduced in Python 2.0 and Python 3.0.
    o   List the key organizations that support Python development and maintenance.
2.Timeline Activity:
    o   Create a timeline of Python’s development from 1991 to the present, highlighting key milestones.
Section 2: Features of Python
3.Identify the Feature:
    o   Which Python feature allows variables to change their type during execution? Provide an example.
    o   Explain why Python is considered cross-platform.
    o   What does it mean that Python is interpreted, and how does this affect debugging?
4.True or False:
    o   Python is only used for web development.
    o   Python manages memory manually.
    o   Python’s syntax is more complex than other programming languages.
5.Practical Task:
    o   Write a Python program demonstrating the following features:
    ▪   Dynamic typing
    ▪   Use of a standard library module (e.g., math or random)
    ▪   Cross-platform compatibility by running it on different operating systems (if possible).
Section 3: Why Python Is Popular
6.Application Research:
    o   Research one Python library for each of the following fields and write a brief description of its purpose:
    ▪   Web Development
    ▪   Data Science
    ▪   Machine Learning
7.Discussion Question:
    o   Why do you think Python has gained popularity across diverse fields like automation, data science, and web development? Write your thoughts in 150–200 words.
Section 4: Memory Management in Python
8.Code Analysis:
    o   Write a Python program demonstrating reference counting. Use the sys.getrefcount() method to verify reference counts for a variable.
    o   Create an example that produces a reference cycle and use the gc module to clear it.
9.  Explain Concepts:
    o   What is the purpose of Python’s garbage collector, and how does it handle reference cycles?
    o   Explain interning with an example.
10.Research Task:
    o   Find a tool or library to monitor Python memory usage and write a brief report on how to use it.
Section 5: Setting Up Python Environment & Writing Programs
11.Installation Task:
    o   Install Python on your machine and verify the installation. Take a screenshot of the terminal output showing the Python version.
12.First Python Program:
    o   Write, save, and run your first Python program to print "Hello, World!" Include steps you followed and the output.
13.Experiment with print():
    o   Use the print() function to achieve the following outputs:
    ▪   Print values separated by a comma (,).
    ▪   Print values on the same line with a space in between.
    ▪   Customize the end character to a period (.).
