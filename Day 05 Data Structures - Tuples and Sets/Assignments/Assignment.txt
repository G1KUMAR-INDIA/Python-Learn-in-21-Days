Day 5: In-Class Assignment - Tuples and Sets
Exercises:
1.Tuple Manipulation:
    o   Create a tuple of your favorite movies.
    o   Print the length of the tuple.
    o   Access and print the second movie in the tuple.
    o   Create a new tuple containing the first three movies from the original tuple.
2.Set Operations:
    o   Create two sets of integers: set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.
    o   Find and print the intersection of set1 and set2.
    o   Find and print the elements that are in set1 but not in set2.
    o   Add the number 8 to set1.
3.Tuple and Set Conversion:
    o   Create a list of fruits.
    o   Convert the list into a tuple.
    o   Convert the tuple into a set.
    o   Print the resulting set (note that duplicates will be removed).

Answers:
1st Question Answer:
# Tuple Manipulation:
# Create a tuple of my favorite movies
pawan_kalyan_movies = (
    "Attarintiki Daredi",
    "Tholi Prema",
    "Khushi",
    "Gabbar Singh",
    "Jalsa",
    "Thammudu",
    "Badri",
    "Bheemla Nayak",
    "Vakeel Saab",
    "Suswagatham"
)
print(pawan_kalyan_movies)

# Printing the length of the tuple
print("Number of movies in the list:", len(pawan_kalyan_movies))

# Accessing and printing the second movie in the tuple
print("Second Movie:", pawan_kalyan_movies[1])

# Creating a new tuple containing the first three movies
first_three_movies = pawan_kalyan_movies[:3]
print("\nFirst three movies:")
for movie in first_three_movies:
    print(movie)

2nd Question Answer:
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
# intersection of set1 and set2
intersection_set  = set1 & set2
print("intersection of set1 and set2:",intersection_set)

# elements that are in set1 but not in set2
# Independent set of set1
independent_set1=set1-set2
print("elements that are in set1 but not in set2:",independent_set1)

# Adding the number 8 to set1
set1.add(8)
print("Set1 after adding 8:",set1)

3rd Question Answer:
# Creating a list of fruits
fruits_list = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Mango", "Banana", "Grapes", "Apple","Banana","Apple","Mango"]
print("List of fruits:",fruits_list)

# Converting the list into a tuple
fruits_tuple = tuple(fruits_list)
print("Tuple of fruits:", fruits_tuple)

# Converting the tuple into a set
fruits_set = set(fruits_tuple)
print("Set of fruits (duplicates removed):", fruits_set)
