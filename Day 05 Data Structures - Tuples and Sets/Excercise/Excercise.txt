Practice Questions related to Tuples and Sets in Python:
Basic Exercises
1.Tuple Manipulation:
    o   Create a tuple containing your favorite colors.
    o   Access and print the first and last elements of the tuple.
    o   Try to modify the first element of the tuple (you should encounter an error).
    o   Create a new tuple by concatenating your original tuple with another tuple.
2.Set Operations:
    o   Create two sets of numbers: set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4} and set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}.
    o   Find and print the union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference of set1 and set2.
    o   Add a new element to set1.
    o   Remove an element from set2.

3.Tuple and List Conversion:
    o   Create a list of names.
    o   Convert the list into a tuple.
    o   Convert the tuple back into a list.
    o   Try to sort the tuple (you should encounter an error).
    o   Sort the list and then convert it back to a tuple.
4.Set Applications:
    o   Create a set of words from a given sentence (remove duplicates).
    o   Write a program to find the common letters between two words.
    o   Given a list of numbers, use a set to find the unique numbers in the list.

5.Tuple Packing and Unpacking:
    o   Create a tuple with multiple values.
    o   Unpack the tuple into individual variables.
    o   Use tuple unpacking to swap the values of two variables.
6.Set Comprehension:
    o   Create a set of squares of even numbers from 1 to 10 using set comprehension.
    o   Create a set of vowels from a given string using set comprehension.
7.Frozenset:
    o   Create a frozenset.
    o   Try to modify the frozenset (you should encounter an error).
    o   Explain the use cases for frozensets.
Remember:
    •   Test your code thoroughly to make sure it produces the expected output.
    •   Read the error messages carefully if you encounter any problems.
    •   Try to solve the problems independently before seeking help.
