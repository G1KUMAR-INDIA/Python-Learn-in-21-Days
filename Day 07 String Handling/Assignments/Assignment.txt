Assignment Questions
    1.Concatenation and Slicing:
        o   Write a program that takes three strings as input:
        ▪   Concatenate the first two strings.
        ▪   Slice the concatenated string to include only characters from index 2 to 8 (inclusive).
        ▪   Print both the concatenated and sliced strings.
    2.Case Conversion:
        o   Write a program to take a string and:
        ▪   Convert it to uppercase.
        ▪   Convert it to lowercase.
        ▪   Swap the case of all characters.
        ▪   Check if the string is in title case.
    3.String Search and Replace:
    o   Write a program to take a sentence and:
    ▪   Search for the word "Python" in the sentence.
    ▪   Replace all occurrences of "Python" with "Java."
    ▪   Print the modified sentence.
    4.Count Specific Characters:
    o   Write a program to count:
    ▪   The number of vowels in a given string.
    ▪   The number of consonants in the string.
    ▪   The number of spaces in the string.

# Answers:
# 1st Question Answer:
# Taking Three Strings from Input
Str1=input("Enter First String: ")
Str2=input("Enter Second String: ")
Str3=input("Enter Third String: ")

print(Str1,Str2,Str3)

# Concatenate the first two strings
Concatenated_Str = Str1 + Str2
print("Concatenated String:",   Concatenated_Str)

# Slice from index 2 to 8 (inclusive)
Sliced_Str = Concatenated_Str[2:9]
print("Sliced String (index 2 to 8):", Sliced_Str)

# Example Output:
# Enter First String: R 
# Enter Second String: JEEVAN
# Enter Third String: KUMAR
# R  JEEVAN KUMAR
# Concatenated String: R JEEVAN
# Sliced String (index 2 to 8): JEEVAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2nd Question Answer:
# Taking String as Input
Str=input("Enter String: ")
print("Entered String: ",Str)

# Uppercase of Input String
print("Uppercase of Input String: ",Str.upper())

# Lowercase of Input String
print("Lowercase of Input String: ",Str.lower())

# Swap the case of all characters
print("Swap case of Input String: ",Str.swapcase())

# Given String is in Title Case
print("Title case of Input String: ",Str.istitle())

# Example Output:
# Enter String: R Jeevan Kumar
# Entered String:  R Jeevan Kumar
# Uppercase of Input String:  R JEEVAN KUMAR
# Lowercase of Input String:  r jeevan kumar
# Swap case of Input String:  r jEEVAN kUMAR
# Title case of Input String:  True

# 3rd Question Answer:
# String Search and Replace
# Enter Sentence as String Input
sentence=input("Enter Sentence: ")
# print("Entered Sentence: ",sentence)

# Searching the word "Python" in the Sentence
if "Python" in sentence:
  print("Word Python is found in Entered Sentence.")
else:
  print("Word Python is not found in Entered Sentence.")

# Replacing all occurrences of "Python" with "Java."
modified_sentence = sentence.replace("Python", "Java")

# Printing the modified sentence
print(modified_sentence)

#  Sample Output
# Enter Sentence: The best programming languages to learn in 2025 include Python, JavaScript, Java, C#, C++, PHP, Ruby, Swift, R, and SQL
# Word Python is found in Entered Sentence.
# The best programming languages to learn in 2025 include Java, JavaScript, Java, C#, C++, PHP, Ruby, Swift, R, and SQL

# 4th Question Answer:
# Giving String in Input
Str=input("Enter a String: ")
vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
consonants = "bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ"

# Counting no. of Vowels in String
vowel_count = sum(1 for char in Str if char in vowels)
print("No. of Vowels in given String:{}".format(vowel_count))

# Counting no. of Consonants in String
consonant_count = sum(1 for char in Str if char in consonants)
print("No. of Consonants: ",consonant_count)

# Counting Spaces in String
space_count = Str.count(" ")
print("No. of Spaces in a String: ",space_count)

#  Sample Output
# Enter a String: The best programming languages to learn in 2025 include Python, JavaScript, Java, C#, C++, PHP, Ruby, Swift, R, and SQL
# No. of Vowels in given String:25
# No. of Consonants:  59
# No. of Spaces in a String:  19
