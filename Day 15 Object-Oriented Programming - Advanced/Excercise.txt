Day15- Practice Exercises (3 Questions)
1. Polymorphism in Real Life
Write a program demonstrating polymorphism with a Vehicle class that has a
fuel_type() method. Implement two child classes:
    . PetrolCar ¨ Returns "Petrol"
    . ElectricCar ¨ Returns "Electric"
Expected Output:
    . Create an instance of each class and call fuel_type().
2. Multiple Inheritance in a Smart Home System
Design a SmartHomeDevice system with:
    • LightSystem class → method turn_on_lights()
    • SecuritySystem class → method activate_alarm()
    • SmartHome class that inherits from both and implements a method
    home_status()
Test Cases:
    • Create a SmartHome object and call all methods.
3. Employee Management System with Multilevel Inheritance
Create:
    • Person class → Attributes: name, age
    • Employee class (inherits Person) → Attributes: employee_id, department
    • Manager class (inherits Employee) → Attributes: team_size
Test Cases:
    • Instantiate a Manager and call a method that displays all attributes.
