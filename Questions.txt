### âœ… **What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**
Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **"objects"**, which contain **data (attributes/variables)** and **code (methods/functions)**.

### ðŸŽ¯ **Purpose of OOP:**
- To model real-world entities.
- To promote **modularity, reusability, and scalability**.
- Makes code more **structured and manageable**.
- Helps in **data encapsulation**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **abstraction**.

### âœ… **What is a Class, Object, and Method?**

| Concept   | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Class** | A blueprint or template to create objects. It defines properties (variables) and behaviors (methods). |
| **Object** | An instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with state and behavior. |
| **Method** | A function defined inside a class that performs actions using the objectâ€™s data. |

ðŸ”¸ **Example in Python:**
```python
class Car:  # Class
    def __init__(self, brand, color):  # Constructor
        self.brand = brand  # Instance Variable
        self.color = color

    def display(self):  # Method
        print(f"Brand: {self.brand}, Color: {self.color}")

car1 = Car("Toyota", "Red")  # Object
car1.display()
```

### âœ… **What are Instance Variables?**
- Variables that are unique to each object.
- Declared using `self.variable_name` inside the class.

```python
self.brand = brand  # 'brand' is an instance variable
```

### âœ… **What is an Instance Method?**
- A method that operates on the **instance variables** of an object.
- Always has `self` as the first parameter.

```python
def display(self):  # Instance method
    print(self.brand)
```

---

### âœ… **What is a Constructor?**
- A **special method** used to initialize objects.
- In Python, the constructor is `__init__()` method.
- Automatically called when an object is created.

### ðŸ“Œ **How to create a constructor:**
```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

s1 = Student("Alice", 22)  # Constructor is called here
```
